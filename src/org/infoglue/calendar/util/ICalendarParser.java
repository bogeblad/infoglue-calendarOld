 * Currently, this is a partial implementation. Its purpose is to parse an iCal file
 * and create a freebusy string loadable out to a file or as a web-response if 
 * a URL.

            line and last line of the ICalendar object MUST contain a pair of
            ICalendar object delimiter strings. The syntax for an ICalendar
            object is as follows:

               The Calendar Properties are attributes that apply to the ICalendar
               object, as a whole. These properties do not appear within a calendar
               component. They SHOULD be specified after the "BEGIN:VCALENDAR"
               property and prior to any calendar component.

            4.7.1 Calendar Scale

               Property Name: CALSCALE

               Purpose: This property defines the calendar scale used for the
               calendar information specified in the ICalendar object.
               Value Type: TEXT

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: Property can be specified in an ICalendar object. The
               default value is "GREGORIAN".

               Description: This memo is based on the Gregorian calendar scale. The
               Gregorian calendar scale is assumed if this property is not specified
               in the ICalendar object. It is expected that other calendar scales
               will be defined in other specifications or by future versions of this
               memo.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 calscale   = "CALSCALE" calparam ":" calvalue CRLF

                 calparam   = *(";" xparam)

               created the ICalendar object.

               Value Type: TEXT

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: The property MUST be specified once in an ICalendar
               object.

               Description: The vendor of the implementation SHOULD assure that this
               is a globally unique identifier; using some technique such as an FPI
               value, as defined in [ISO 9070].

               This property SHOULD not be used to alter the interpretation of an
               ICalendar object beyond the semantics specified in this memo. For
               example, it is not to be used to further the understanding of non-
               standard properties.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 prodid     = "PRODID" pidparam ":" pidvalue CRLF
                 pidparam   = *(";" xparam)

                 ;and that is generally assured of being unique.

               Example: The following is an example of this property. It does not
               imply that English is the default language.

               highest version number or the minimum and maximum range of the
               ICalendar specification that is required in order to interpret the
               ICalendar object.

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property MUST be specified by an ICalendar object,
               but MUST only be specified once.

               value data type property parameters can be specified on this
               property.

               Conformance: The property can be specified in a "VEVENT", "VTODO",
               "VJOURNAL" or "VALARM" calendar components.

               Description: The property can be specified within "VEVENT", "VTODO",
               "VJOURNAL", or "VALARM" calendar components. This property can be
               specified multiple times within an ICalendar object.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

               Description: This property is used to specify categories or subtypes
               of the calendar component. The categories are useful in searching for
               a calendar component of a particular type and category. Within the
               "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar components, more than one

            Purpose: This property defines the access classification for a
            calendar component.

            Value Type: TEXT

            Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
            specified on this property.

            Conformance: The property can be specified once in a "VEVENT",
            "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

            Description: An access classification is only one component of the
            general security system within a calendar application. It provides a
            method of capturing the scope of the access the calendar owner
            intends for information within an individual calendar entry. The
            access classification of an individual ICalendar component is useful
            when measured along with the other security components of a calendar
            system (e.g., calendar user authentication, authorization, access
            rights, access role, etc.). Hence, the semantics of the individual
            access classifications cannot be completely defined by this memo
            alone. Additionally, due to the "blind" nature of most exchange

            as an enforcement statement for a system receiving an ICalendar

               Purpose: This property specifies information related to the global
               position for the activity specified by a calendar component.

               Value Type: FLOAT. The value MUST be two SEMICOLON separated FLOAT
               values.

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property can be specified in  "VEVENT" or "VTODO"
               calendar components.

               Description: The property value specifies latitude and longitude, in
               that order (i.e., "LAT LON" ordering). The longitude represents the
               location east or west of the prime meridian as a positive or negative
               real number, respectively. The longitude and latitude values MAY be
               specified up to six decimal places, which will allow for accuracy to
               within one meter of geographical position. Receiving applications
               MUST accept values of this precision and MAY truncate values of
               greater precision.

               Values for latitude and longitude shall be expressed as decimal
               fractions of degrees. Whole degrees of latitude shall be represented
               by a two-digit decimal number ranging from 0 through 90. Whole
               degrees of longitude shall be represented by a decimal number ranging
               from 0 through 180. When a decimal fraction of a degree is specified,
               it shall be separated from the whole number of degrees by a decimal
               point.

               Latitudes north of the equator shall be specified by a plus sign (+),
               or by the absence of a minus sign (-), preceding the digits
               designating degrees. Latitudes south of the Equator shall be
               designated by a minus sign (-) preceding the digits designating
               degrees. A point on the Equator shall be assigned to the Northern
               Hemisphere.

               Longitudes east of the prime meridian shall be specified by a plus
               sign (+), or by the absence of a minus sign (-), preceding the digits
               designating degrees. Longitudes west of the meridian shall be
               designated by minus sign (-) preceding the digits designating
               degrees. A point on the prime meridian shall be assigned to the
               Eastern Hemisphere. A point on the 180th meridian shall be assigned
               to the Western Hemisphere. One exception to this last convention is
               permitted. For the special condition of describing a band of latitude
               around the earth, the East Bounding Coordinate data element shall be
               assigned the value +180 (180) degrees.

               Any spatial address with a latitude of +90 (90) or -90 degrees will
               specify the position at the North or South Pole, respectively. The
               component for longitude may have any legal value.

               With the exception of the special condition described above, this
               form is specified in Department of Commerce, 1986, Representation of
               geographic point locations for information interchange (Federal
               Information Processing Standard 70-1):  Washington,  Department of
               Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology.

               The simple formula for converting degrees-minutes-seconds into
               decimal degrees is:

                 decimal = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600.

               representation may be specified that is a URI that points to
               directory information with more structured specification of the
               location. For example, the alternate representation may specify

               Purpose: This property is used by an assignee or delegatee of a to-do
               to convey the percent completion of a to-do to the Organizer.

               Value Type: INTEGER

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property can be specified in a "VTODO" calendar
               component.

               Description: The property value is a positive integer between zero
               and one hundred. A value of "0" indicates the to-do has not yet been
               started. A value of "100" indicates that the to-do has been
               completed. Integer values in between indicate the percent partially
               complete.

               When a to-do is assigned to multiple individuals, the property value
               indicates the percent complete for that portion of the to-do assigned
               to the assignee or delegatee. For example, if a to-do is assigned to
               both individuals "A" and "B". A reply from "A" with a percent
               complete of "70" indicates that "A" has completed 70% of the to-do

               Purpose: The property defines the relative priority for a calendar
               component.

               Value Type: INTEGER

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: The property can be specified in a "VEVENT" or "VTODO"
               calendar component.

               Description: The priority is specified as an integer in the range
               zero to nine. A value of zero (US-ASCII decimal 48) specifies an
               undefined priority. A value of one (US-ASCII decimal 49) is the
               highest priority. A value of two (US-ASCII decimal 50) is the second
               highest priority. Subsequent numbers specify a decreasing ordinal
               priority. A value of nine (US-ASCII decimal 58) is the lowest
               priority.

               A CUA with a three-level priority scheme of "HIGH", "MEDIUM" and
               "LOW" is mapped into this property such that a property value in the
               range of one (US-ASCII decimal 49) to four (US-ASCII decimal 52)
               specifies "HIGH" priority. A value of five (US-ASCII decimal 53) is
               the normal or "MEDIUM" priority. A value in the range of six (US-
               ASCII decimal 54) to nine (US-ASCII decimal 58) is "LOW" priority.

               A CUA with a priority schema of "A1", "A2", "A3", "B1", "B2", ...,
               "C3" is mapped into this property such that a property value of one
               (US-ASCII decimal 49) specifies "A1", a property value of two (US-
               ASCII decimal 50) specifies "A2", a property value of three (US-ASCII
               decimal 51) specifies "A3", and so forth up to a property value of 9
               (US-ASCII decimal 58) specifies "C3".

               Other integer values are reserved for future use.

               Within a "VEVENT" calendar component, this property specifies a
               priority for the event. This property may be useful when more than
               one event is scheduled for a given time period.

               Within a "VTODO" calendar component, this property specified a
               priority for the to-do. This property is useful in prioritizing
               multiple action items for a given time period.

               Format Definition: The property is specified by the following
               notation:

                 priority   = "PRIORITY" prioparam ":" privalue CRLF
                 ;Default is zero

                 prioparam  = *(";" xparam)

                 privalue   = integer       ;Must be in the range [0..9]
                    ; All other values are reserved for future use

               The following is an example of a property with the highest priority:

                 PRIORITY:1

               The following is an example of a property with a next highest
               priority:

               Example: The following is an example of a property with no priority.
               This is equivalent to not specifying the "PRIORITY" property:

               date/time. In a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component the property may be
               used to specify the interval of free time being requested. In a
               "VALARM" calendar component the property may be used to specify the
               delay period prior to repeating an alarm.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 duration   = "DURATION" durparam ":" dur-value CRLF
                              ;consisting of a positive duration of time.

                 durparam   = *(";" xparam)

               Example: The following is an example of this property that specifies
               an interval of time of 1 hour and zero minutes and zero seconds:

                 DURATION:PT1H0M0S

               The following is an example of this property that specifies an
               interval of time of 15 minutes.

                 DURATION:PT15M

               Description: A "VEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of component
               properties, and possibly including "VALARM" calendar components, that
               represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar. For example, it
               can be an activity; such as a one-hour long, department meeting from
               8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow. Generally, an event will take up time
               on an individual calendar. Hence, the event will appear as an opaque
               interval in a search for busy time. Alternately, the event can have
               its Time Transparency set to "TRANSPARENT" in order to prevent
               blocking of the event in searches for busy time.    
               The "VEVENT" is also the calendar component used to specify an
               anniversary or daily reminder within a calendar. These events have a
               DATE value type for the "DTSTART" property instead of the default
               data type of DATE-TIME. If such a "VEVENT" has a "DTEND" property, it
               MUST be specified as a DATE value also. The anniversary type of
               "VEVENT" can span more than one date (i.e, "DTEND" property value is
               set to a calendar date after the "DTSTART" property value).    
               The "DTSTART" property for a "VEVENT" specifies the inclusive start
               of the event. For recurring events, it also specifies the very first
               instance in the recurrence set. The "DTEND" property for a "VEVENT"
               calendar component specifies the non-inclusive end of the event. For
               cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component specifies a "DTSTART"
               property with a DATE data type but no "DTEND" property, the events
               non-inclusive end is the end of the calendar date specified by the
               "DTSTART" property. For cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component
               specifies a "DTSTART" property with a DATE-TIME data type but no
               "DTEND" property, the event ends on the same calendar date and time
               of day specified by the "DTSTART" property. 
               The "VEVENT" calendar component cannot be nested within another
               calendar component. However, "VEVENT" calendar components can be
               related to each other or to a "VTODO" or to a "VJOURNAL" calendar
               component with the "RELATED-TO" property.

             Description: A "VTODO" calendar component is a grouping of component
               properties and possibly "VALARM" calendar components that represent
               an action-item or assignment. For example, it can be used to
               represent an item of work assigned to an individual; such as "turn in
               travel expense today".    The "VTODO" calendar component cannot be nested within another
               calendar component. However, "VTODO" calendar components can be
               related to each other or to a "VTODO" or to a "VJOURNAL" calendar
               component with the "RELATED-TO" property. 
             A "VTODO" calendar component without the "DTSTART" and "DUE" (or
                "DURATION") properties specifies a to-do that will be associated with
                each successive calendar date, until it is completed.

              Description: A "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is a grouping of
               component properties that represents either a request for, a reply to
               a request for free or busy time information or a published set of
               busy time information.    When used to request free/busy time information, the "ATTENDEE"
               property specifies the calendar users whose free/busy time is being
               requested; the "ORGANIZER" property specifies the calendar user who
               is requesting the free/busy time; the "DTSTART" and "DTEND"
               properties specify the window of time for which the free/busy time is
               being requested; the "UID" and "DTSTAMP" properties are specified to
               assist in proper sequencing of multiple free/busy time requests.    
               When used to reply to a request for free/busy time, the "ATTENDEE"
               property specifies the calendar user responding to the free/busy time
               request; the "ORGANIZER" property specifies the calendar user that
               originally requested the free/busy time; the "FREEBUSY" property
               specifies the free/busy time information (if it exists); and the 
               "UID" and "DTSTAMP" properties are specified to assist in proper
               sequencing of multiple free/busy time replies.    
               When used to publish busy time, the "ORGANIZER" property specifies
               the calendar user associated with the published busy time; the
               "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties specify an inclusive time window
               that surrounds the busy time information; the "FREEBUSY" property
               specifies the published busy time information; and the "DTSTAMP"
               property specifies the date/time that ICalendar object was created.    
               The "VFREEBUSY" calendar component cannot be nested within another
               calendar component. Multiple "VFREEBUSY" calendar components can be
               specified within an ICalendar object. This permits the grouping of
               Free/Busy information into logical collections, such as monthly
               groups of busy time information.    
               The "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is intended for use in ICalendar
               object methods involving requests for free time, requests for busy
               time, requests for both free and busy, and the associated replies.    
               Free/Busy information is represented with the "FREEBUSY" property.
               This property provides a terse representation of time periods. One or
               more "FREEBUSY" properties can be specified in the "VFREEBUSY"
               calendar component.    
               When present in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component, the "DTSTART" and
               "DTEND" properties SHOULD be specified prior to any "FREEBUSY"
               properties. In a free time request, these properties can be used in
               combination with the "DURATION" property to represent a request for a
               duration of free time within a specified window of time.    
               The recurrence properties ("RRULE", "EXRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE") are
               not permitted within a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component. Any recurring
               events are resolved into their individual busy time periods using the
               "FREEBUSY" property.    
               Example: The following is an example of a "VFREEBUSY" calendar
               component used to request free or busy time information:      
                 BEGIN:VFREEBUSY

           Description: A time zone is unambiguously defined by the set of time
           measurement rules determined by the governing body for a given
           geographic area. These rules describe at a minimum the base  offset
           from UTC for the time zone, often referred to as the Standard Time
           offset. Many locations adjust their Standard Time forward or backward
           by one hour, in order to accommodate seasonal changes in number of
           daylight hours, often referred to as Daylight  Saving Time. Some
           locations adjust their time by a fraction of an hour. Standard Time
           is also known as Winter Time. Daylight Saving Time is also known as
           Advanced Time, Summer Time, or Legal Time in certain countries. The
           following table shows the changes in time zone rules in effect for
           New York City starting from 1967. Each line represents a description
           or rule for a particular observance.

                Note: The specification of a global time zone registry is not
                addressed by this document and is left for future study.
                However, implementers may find the Olson time zone database [TZ]
                a useful reference. It is an informal, public-domain collection
                of time zone information, which is currently being maintained by
                volunteer Internet participants, and is used in several
                operating systems. This database contains current and historical
                time zone information for a wide variety of locations around the
                globe; it provides a time zone identifier for every unique time
                zone rule set in actual use since 1970, with historical data
                going back to the introduction of standard time.

           Interoperability between two calendaring and scheduling applications,
           especially for recurring events, to-dos or journal entries, is
           dependent on the ability to capture and convey date and time
           information in an unambiguous format. The specification of current
           time zone information is integral to this behavior.

           If present, the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component defines the set of
           Standard Time and Daylight Saving Time observances (or rules) for a
           particular time zone for a given interval of time. The "VTIMEZONE"
           calendar component cannot be nested within other calendar components.
           Multiple "VTIMEZONE" calendar components can exist in an ICalendar
           object. In this situation, each "VTIMEZONE" MUST represent a unique
           time zone definition. This is necessary for some classes of events,
           such as airline flights, that start in one time zone and end in
           another.

           The "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST be present if the ICalendar
           object contains an RRULE that generates dates on both sides of a time
           zone shift (e.g. both in Standard Time and Daylight Saving Time)
           unless the ICalendar object intends to convey a floating time (See
           the section "4.1.10.11 Time" for proper interpretation of floating
           time). It can be present if the ICalendar object does not contain
           such a RRULE. In addition, if a RRULE is present, there MUST be valid
           time zone information for all recurrence instances.

           The "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST include the "TZID" property
           and at least one definition of a standard or daylight component. The
           standard or daylight component MUST include the "DTSTART",
           "TZOFFSETFROM" and "TZOFFSETTO" properties.

           An individual "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST be specified for
           each unique "TZID" parameter value specified in the ICalendar object.

           Each "VTIMEZONE" calendar component consists of a collection of one
           or more sub-components that describe the rule for a particular
           observance (either a Standard Time or a Daylight Saving Time
           observance). The "STANDARD" sub-component consists of a collection of
           properties that describe Standard Time. The "DAYLIGHT" sub-component
           consists of a collection of properties that describe Daylight Saving
           Time. In general this collection of properties consists of:

                - the first onset date-time for the observance

                - the last onset date-time for the observance, if a last onset
                  is known.

                - the offset to be applied for the observance

                - a rule that describes the day and time when the observance
                  takes effect

                - an optional name for the observance

           For a given time zone, there may be multiple unique definitions of
           the observances over a period of time. Each observance is described
           using either a "STANDARD" or "DAYLIGHT" sub-component. The collection
           of these sub-components is used to describe the time zone for a given
           period of time. The offset to apply at any given time is found by
           locating the observance that has the last onset date and time before
           the time in question, and using the offset value from that observance.

           The top-level properties in a "VTIMEZONE" calendar component are:

           The mandatory "TZID" property is a text value that uniquely
           identifies the VTIMZONE calendar component within the scope of an
           ICalendar object.

           The optional "LAST-MODIFIED" property is a UTC value that specifies
           the date and time that this time zone definition was last updated.

           The optional "TZURL" property is url value that points to a published
           VTIMEZONE definition. TZURL SHOULD refer to a resource that is
           accessible by anyone who might need to interpret the object. This
           SHOULD NOT normally be a file: URL or other URL that is not widely-
           accessible.

           The collection of properties that are used to define the STANDARD and
           DAYLIGHT sub-components include:

           The mandatory "DTSTART" property gives the effective onset date and
           local time for the time zone sub-component definition. "DTSTART" in
           this usage MUST be specified as a local DATE-TIME value.

           The mandatory "TZOFFSETFROM" property gives the UTC offset which is
           in use when the onset of this time zone observance begins.
           "TZOFFSETFROM" is combined with "DTSTART" to define the effective
           onset for the time zone sub-component definition. For example, the
           following represents the time at which the observance of Standard
           Time took effect in Fall 1967 for New York City:

             DTSTART:19671029T020000

             TZOFFSETFROM:-0400

           The mandatory "TZOFFSETTO " property gives the UTC offset for the
           time zone sub-component (Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time) when
           this observance is in use.

           The optional "TZNAME" property is the customary name for the time
           zone. It may be specified multiple times, to allow for specifying
           multiple language variants of the time zone names. This could be used
           for displaying dates.

           If specified, the onset for the observance defined by the time zone
           sub-component is defined by either the "RRULE" or "RDATE" property.
           If neither is specified, only one sub-component can be specified in
           the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component and it is assumed that the single
           observance specified is always in effect.

           The "RRULE" property defines the recurrence rule for the onset of the
           observance defined by this time zone sub-component. Some specific
           requirements for the usage of RRULE for this purpose include:

                - If observance is known to have an effective end date, the
                "UNTIL" recurrence rule parameter MUST be used to specify the
                last valid onset of this observance (i.e., the UNTIL date-time
                will be equal to the last instance generated by the recurrence
                pattern). It MUST be specified in UTC time.

                - The "DTSTART" and the "TZOFFSETTO" properties MUST be used
                when generating the onset date-time values (instances) from the
                RRULE.

           Alternatively, the "RDATE" property can be used to define the onset
           of the observance by giving the individual onset date and times.
           "RDATE" in this usage MUST be specified as a local DATE-TIME value in
           UTC time.

           The optional "COMMENT" property is also allowed for descriptive
           explanatory text.

           Example: The following are examples of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar
           component:

           This is an example showing time zone information for the Eastern
           United States using "RDATE" property. Note that this is only suitable
           for a recurring event that starts on or later than April 6, 1997 at
           03:00:00 EDT (i.e., the earliest effective transition date and time)
           and ends no later than April 7, 1998 02:00:00 EST (i.e., latest valid
           date and time for EST in this scenario). For example, this can be
           used for a recurring event that occurs every Friday, 8am-9:00 AM,
           starting June 1, 1997, ending December 31, 1997.

           This is a simple example showing the current time zone rules for the
           Eastern United States using a RRULE recurrence pattern. Note that
           there is no effective end date to either of the Standard Time or
           Daylight Time rules. This information would be valid for a recurring
           event starting today and continuing indefinitely.

           This is an example showing a fictitious set of rules for the Eastern
           United States, where the Daylight Time rule has an effective end date
           (i.e., after that date, Daylight Time is no longer observed).

           This is an example showing a fictitious set of rules for the Eastern
           United States, where the first Daylight Time rule has an effective

           the other left off.

               Description: A "VALARM" calendar component is a grouping of component
               properties that is a reminder or alarm for an event or a to-do. For
               example, it may be used to define a reminder for a pending event or
               an overdue to-do.

               The "VALARM" calendar component MUST include the "ACTION" and
               "TRIGGER" properties. The "ACTION" property further constrains the
               "VALARM" calendar component in the following ways:

               When the action is "AUDIO", the alarm can also include one and only
               one "ATTACH" property, which MUST point to a sound resource, which is
               rendered when the alarm is triggered.

               When the action is "DISPLAY", the alarm MUST also include a
               "DESCRIPTION" property, which contains the text to be displayed when
               the alarm is triggered.

               When the action is "EMAIL", the alarm MUST include a "DESCRIPTION"
               property, which contains the text to be used as the message body, a
               "SUMMARY" property, which contains the text to be used as the message
               subject, and one or more "ATTENDEE" properties, which contain the
               email address of attendees to receive the message. It can also
               include one or more "ATTACH" properties, which are intended to be
               sent as message attachments. When the alarm is triggered, the email
               message is sent.

               When the action is "PROCEDURE", the alarm MUST include one and only
               one "ATTACH" property, which MUST point to a procedure resource,
               which is invoked when the alarm is triggered.

               The "VALARM" calendar component MUST only appear within either a
               "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component. "VALARM" calendar components
               cannot be nested. Multiple mutually independent "VALARM" calendar
               components can be specified for a single "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar
               component.

               The "TRIGGER" property specifies when the alarm will be triggered.
               The "TRIGGER" property specifies a duration prior to the start of an
               event or a to-do. The "TRIGGER" edge may be explicitly set to be
               relative to the "START" or "END" of the event or to-do with the
               "RELATED" parameter of the "TRIGGER" property. The "TRIGGER" property
               value type can alternatively be set to an absolute calendar date and
               time of day value.

               In an alarm set to trigger on the "START" of an event or to-do, the
               "DTSTART" property MUST be present in the associated event or to-do.
               In an alarm in a "VEVENT" calendar component set to trigger on the
               "END" of the event, either the "DTEND" property MUST be present, or
               the "DTSTART" and "DURATION" properties MUST both be present. In an
               alarm in a "VTODO" calendar component set to trigger on the "END" of
               the to-do, either the "DUE" property MUST be present, or the
               "DTSTART" and "DURATION" properties MUST both be present.

               The alarm can be defined such that it triggers repeatedly. A
               definition of an alarm with a repeating trigger MUST include both the
               "DURATION" and "REPEAT" properties. The "DURATION" property specifies
               the delay period, after which the alarm will repeat. The "REPEAT"
               property specifies the number of additional repetitions that the
               alarm will triggered. This repitition count is in addition to the
               initial triggering of the alarm. Both of these properties MUST be
               present in order to specify a repeating alarm. If one of these two
               properties is absent, then the alarm will not repeat beyond the
               initial trigger.

               The "ACTION" property is used within the "VALARM" calendar component
               to specify the type of action invoked when the alarm is triggered.
               The "VALARM" properties provide enough information for a specific
               action to be invoked. It is typically the responsibility of a
               "Calendar User Agent" (CUA) to deliver the alarm in the specified
               fashion. An "ACTION" property value of AUDIO specifies an alarm that
               causes a sound to be played to alert the user; DISPLAY specifies an
               alarm that causes a text message to be displayed to the user; EMAIL
               specifies an alarm that causes an electronic email message to be
               delivered to one or more email addresses; and PROCEDURE specifies an
               alarm that causes a procedure to be executed. The "ACTION" property
               MUST specify one and only one of these values.

               In an AUDIO alarm, if the optional "ATTACH" property is included, it
               MUST specify an audio sound resource. The intention is that the sound
               will be played as the alarm effect. If an "ATTACH" property is
               specified that does not refer to a sound resource, or if the
               specified sound resource cannot be rendered (because its format is
               unsupported, or because it cannot be retrieved), then the CUA or
               other entity responsible for playing the sound may choose a fallback
               action, such as playing a built-in default sound, or playing no sound
               at all.

               In a DISPLAY alarm, the intended alarm effect is for the text value
               of the "DESCRIPTION" property to be displayed to the user.

               In an EMAIL alarm, the intended alarm effect is for an email message
               to be composed and delivered to all the addresses specified by the
               "ATTENDEE" properties in the "VALARM" calendar component. The
               "DESCRIPTION" property of the "VALARM" calendar component MUST be
               used as the body text of the message, and the "SUMMARY" property MUST
               be used as the subject text. Any "ATTACH" properties in the "VALARM"
               calendar component SHOULD be sent as attachments to the message.

               In a PROCEDURE alarm, the "ATTACH" property in the "VALARM" calendar
               component MUST specify a procedure or program that is intended to be
               invoked as the alarm effect. If the procedure or program is in a
               format that cannot be rendered, then no procedure alarm will be
               invoked. If the "DESCRIPTION" property is present, its value
               specifies the argument string to be passed to the procedure or
               program. "Calendar User Agents" that receive an ICalendar object with
               this category of alarm, can disable or allow the "Calendar User" to
               disable, or otherwise ignore this type of alarm. While a very useful
               alarm capability, the PROCEDURE type of alarm SHOULD be treated by
               the "Calendar User Agent" as a potential security risk.

               Example: The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component
               that specifies an audio alarm that will sound at a precise time and
               repeat 4 more times at 15 minute intervals:

                 BEGIN:VALARM
                 TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME:19970317T133000Z
                 REPEAT:4
                 DURATION:PT15M

                 ATTACH;FMTTYPE=audio/basic:ftp://host.com/pub/sounds/bell-01.aud
                 END:VALARM

               The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component that
               specifies a display alarm that will trigger 30 minutes before the
               scheduled start of the event or the due date/time of the to-do it is
               associated with and will repeat 2 more times at 15 minute intervals:

                 BEGIN:VALARM
                 TRIGGER:-PT30M
                 REPEAT:2
                 DURATION:PT15M

                 END:VALARM

               The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component that
               specifies an email alarm that will trigger 2 days before the
               scheduled due date/time of a to-do it is associated with. It does not
               repeat. The email has a subject, body and attachment link.

                 BEGIN:VALARM
                 TRIGGER:-P2D

               Description: Time Transparency is the characteristic of an event that
               determines whether it appears to consume time on a calendar. Events
               that consume actual time for the individual or resource associated

               with the calendar SHOULD be recorded as OPAQUE, allowing them to be
               detected by free-busy time searches. Other events, which do not take
               up the individual's (or resource's) time SHOULD be recorded as
               TRANSPARENT, making them invisible to free-busy time searches.

               Format Definition: The property is specified by the following
               notation:

                 transp     = "TRANSP" tranparam ":" transvalue CRLF

                 tranparam  = *(";" xparam)

               Value Type: TEXT

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property MUST be specified in a "VTIMEZONE"
               calendar component.

               Description: 
               This is the label by which a time zone calendar
               component is referenced by any ICalendar properties whose data type
               is either DATE-TIME or TIME and not intended to specify a UTC or a
               "floating" time. The presence of the SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII

               unique ID in a globally defined time zone registry (when such
               registry is defined).

                    Note: This document does not define a naming convention for time
                    zone identifiers. Implementers may want to use the naming
                    conventions defined in existing time zone specifications such as
                    the public-domain Olson database [TZ]. The specification of
                    globally unique time zone identifiers is not addressed by this
                    document and is left for future study.

               Format Definition: This property is defined by the following

               Property Name: TZOFFSETFROM

               Purpose: This property specifies the offset which is in use prior to
               this time zone observance.

               Value Type: UTC-OFFSET

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property MUST be specified in a "VTIMEZONE"
               calendar component.

               Description: This property specifies the offset which is in use prior
               to this time observance. It is used to calculate the absolute time at
               which the transition to a given observance takes place. This property
               MUST only be specified in a "VTIMEZONE" calendar component. A
               "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST include this property. The
               property value is a signed numeric indicating the number of hours and
               possibly minutes from UTC. Positive numbers represent time zones east
               of the prime meridian, or ahead of UTC. Negative numbers represent
               time zones west of the prime meridian, or behind UTC.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property can be specified in a "VTIMEZONE" calendar
               component.

               Description: The TZURL provides a means for a VTIMEZONE component to
               point to a network location that can be used to retrieve an up-to-
               date version of itself. This provides a hook to handle changes
               government bodies impose upon time zone definitions. Retrieval of
               this resource results in an ICalendar object containing a single
               VTIMEZONE component and a METHOD property set to PUBLISH.

                   Property Name: ATTENDEE

                   Purpose: The property defines an "Attendee" within a calendar
                   component.

                   Value Type: CAL-ADDRESS

                   Property Parameters: Non-standard, language, calendar user type,
                   group or list membership, participation role, participation status,
                   RSVP expectation, delegatee, delegator, sent by, common name or
                   directory entry reference property parameters can be specified on
                   this property.

                   Conformance: This property MUST be specified in an ICalendar object
                   that specifies a group scheduled calendar entity. This property MUST
                   NOT be specified in an ICalendar object when publishing the calendar
                   information (e.g., NOT in an ICalendar object that specifies the
                   publication of a calendar user's busy time, event, to-do or journal).
                   This property is not specified in an ICalendar object that specifies
                   only a time zone definition or that defines calendar entities that
                   are not group scheduled entities, but are entities only on a single
                   user's calendar.

                   Description: The property MUST only be specified within calendar
                   components to specify participants, non-participants and the chair of
                   a group scheduled calendar entity. The property is specified within
                   an "EMAIL" category of the "VALARM" calendar component to specify an
                   email address that is to receive the email type of ICalendar alarm.

                   The property parameter CN is for the common or displayable name
                   associated with the calendar address; ROLE, for the intended role
                   that the attendee will have in the calendar component; PARTSTAT, for
                   the status of the attendee's participation; RSVP, for indicating
                   whether the favor of a reply is requested; CUTYPE, to indicate the
                   type of calendar user; MEMBER, to indicate the groups that the
                   attendee belongs to; DELEGATED-TO, to indicate the calendar users
                   that the original request was delegated to; and DELEGATED-FROM, to
                   indicate whom the request was delegated from; SENT-BY, to indicate
                   whom is acting on behalf of the ATTENDEE; and DIR, to indicate the
                   URI that points to the directory information corresponding to the
                   attendee. These property parameters can be specified on an "ATTENDEE"
                   property in either a "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar
                   component. They MUST not be specified in an "ATTENDEE" property in a
                   "VFREEBUSY" or "VALARM" calendar component. If the LANGUAGE property
                   parameter is specified, the identified language applies to the CN
                   parameter.

                   A recipient delegated a request MUST inherit the RSVP and ROLE values
                   from the attendee that delegated the request to them.

                   Multiple attendees can be specified by including multiple "ATTENDEE"
                   properties within the calendar component.

                   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

               "VFREEBUSY" calendar component to specify the calendar user
               requesting the free or busy time. When publishing a "VFREEBUSY"
               calendar component, the property is used to specify the calendar that
               the published busy time came from.

               The property has the property parameters CN, for specifying the
               common or display name associated with the "Organizer", DIR, for
               specifying a pointer to the directory information associated with the
               "Organizer", SENT-BY, for specifying another calendar user that is
               acting on behalf of the "Organizer". The non-standard parameters may
               also be specified on this property. If the LANGUAGE property
               parameter is specified, the identified language applies to the CN
               parameter value.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

             4.8.4.4 Recurrence ID

               Property Name: RECURRENCE-ID

               Purpose: This property is used in conjunction with the "UID" and
               "SEQUENCE" property to identify a specific instance of a recurring
               "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar component. The property
               value is the effective value of the "DTSTART" property of the
               recurrence instance.

               Value Type: The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
               The time format can be any of the valid forms defined for a DATE-TIME
               value type. See DATE-TIME value type definition for specific
               interpretations of the various forms. The value type can be set to
               DATE.

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property, value data type, time
               zone identifier and recurrence identifier range parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property can be specified in an ICalendar object
               containing a recurring calendar component.

               Description: The full range of calendar components specified by a
               recurrence set is referenced by referring to just the "UID" property
               value corresponding to the calendar component. The "RECURRENCE-ID"
               property allows the reference to an individual instance within the
               recurrence set.

               If the value of the "DTSTART" property is a DATE type value, then the
               value MUST be the calendar date for the recurrence instance.

               The date/time value is set to the time when the original recurrence
               instance would occur; meaning that if the intent is to change a
               Friday meeting to Thursday, the date/time is still set to the
               original Friday meeting.

               The "RECURRENCE-ID" property is used in conjunction with the "UID"
               and "SEQUENCE" property to identify a particular instance of a
               recurring event, to-do or journal. For a given pair of "UID" and
               "SEQUENCE" property values, the "RECURRENCE-ID" value for a
               recurrence instance is fixed. When the definition of the recurrence
               set for a calendar component changes, and hence the "SEQUENCE"
               property value changes, the "RECURRENCE-ID" for a given recurrence
               instance might also change.The "RANGE" parameter is used to specify
               the effective range of recurrence instances from the instance
               specified by the "RECURRENCE-ID" property value. The default value
               for the range parameter is the single recurrence instance only. The
               value can also be "THISANDPRIOR" to indicate a range defined by the
               given recurrence instance and all prior instances or the value can be
               "THISANDFUTURE" to indicate a range defined by the given recurrence
               instance and all subsequent instances.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 recurid    = "RECURRENCE-ID" ridparam ":" ridval CRLF

                 ridparam   = *(

                            ; the following are optional,

             /*
            4.8.4.5 Related To

               Property Name: RELATED-TO

               Purpose: The property is used to represent a relationship or
               reference between one calendar component and another.

               Value Type: TEXT

               Property Parameters: Non-standard and relationship type property
               parameters can be specified on this property.

               Conformance: The property can be specified one or more times in the
               "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

               Description: The property value consists of the persistent, globally
               unique identifier of another calendar component. This value would be
               represented in a calendar component by the "UID" property.

               By default, the property value points to another calendar component
               that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing object. The
               "RELTYPE" property parameter is used to either explicitly state the
               default PARENT relationship type to the referenced calendar component
               or to override the default PARENT relationship type and specify
               either a CHILD or SIBLING relationship. The PARENT relationship
               indicates that the calendar component is a subordinate of the
               referenced calendar component. The CHILD relationship indicates that
               the calendar component is a superior of the referenced calendar
               component. The SIBLING relationship indicates that the calendar
               component is a peer of the referenced calendar component.
              
               Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can have
               an implicit impact on the related calendar component. For example, if
               a group event changes its start or end date or time, then the
               related, dependent events will need to have their start and end dates
               changed in a corresponding way. Similarly, if a PARENT calendar
               component is canceled or deleted, then there is an implied impact to
               the related CHILD calendar components. This property is intended only
               to provide information on the relationship of calendar components. It
               is up to the target calendar system to maintain any property
               implications of this relationship.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 related    = "RELATED-TO" [relparam] ":" text CRLF

               Description: This property may be used in a calendar component to
               convey a location where a more dynamic rendition of the calendar
               information associated with the calendar component can be found. This
               memo does not attempt to standardize the form of the URI, nor the
               format of the resource pointed to by the property value. If the URL
               property and Content-Location MIME header are both specified, they

            4.8.5 Recurrence Component Properties

               The following properties specify recurrence information in calendar
               components.

            4.8.5.1 Exception Date/Times

               Property Name: EXDATE

               Purpose: This property defines the list of date/time exceptions for a
               recurring calendar component.

               Value Type: The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
               The value type can be set to DATE.

               Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type and time zone
               identifier property parameters can be specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property can be specified in an ICalendar object
               that includes a recurring calendar component.

               Description: The exception dates, if specified, are used in computing
               the recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of
               recurrence instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is
               generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with
               the "RRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained
               within the ICalendar object. The "DTSTART" property defines the first
               instance in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and
               "EXRULE" properties can also be specified to define more
               sophisticated recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated
               by gathering all of the start date-times generated by any of the
               specified "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, and then excluding any
               start date and times which fall within the union of start date and
               times generated by any specified "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties.
               This implies that start date and times within exclusion related
               properties (i.e., "EXDATE" and "EXRULE") take precedence over those
               specified by inclusion properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where
               duplicate instances are generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE"
               properties, only one recurrence is considered. Duplicate instances
               are ignored.

               The "EXDATE" property can be used to exclude the value specified in
               "DTSTART". However, in such cases the original "DTSTART" date MUST
               still be maintained by the calendaring and scheduling system because
               the original "DTSTART" value has inherent usage dependencies by other
               properties such as the "RECURRENCE-ID".

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 exdate     = "EXDATE" exdtparam ":" exdtval *("," exdtval) CRLF

                 exdtparam  = *(

                            ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

               recurring "VEVENT", "VTODO" and "VJOURNAL" calendar components. It
               can also be specified once in each STANDARD or DAYLIGHT sub-component
               of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component.

               Description: The recurrence rule, if specified, is used in computing
               the recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of
               recurrence instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is
               generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with
               the "RRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained

               instance in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and
               "EXRULE" properties can also be specified to define more
               sophisticated recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated
               by gathering all of the start date/times generated by any of the
               specified "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start
               date/times which fall within the union of start date/times generated
               by any specified "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that
               start date/times within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE"
               and "EXRULE") take precedence over those specified by inclusion
               properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are
               generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence
               is considered. Duplicate instances are ignored.

               The "DTSTART" and "DTEND" property pair or "DTSTART" and "DURATION"
               property pair, specified within the ICalendar object defines the
               first instance of the recurrence. When used with a recurrence rule,
               the "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties MUST be specified in local time
               and the appropriate set of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components MUST be
               included. For detail on the usage of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar
               component, see the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component definition.

               Any duration associated with the ICalendar object applies to all
               members of the generated recurrence set. Any modified duration for
               specific recurrences MUST be explicitly specified using the "RDATE"
               property.

               Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
               notation:

                 rrule      = "RRULE" rrulparam ":" recur CRLF

                 rrulparam  = *(";" xparam)

               Example: All examples assume the Eastern United States time zone.

            4.8.7 Change Management Component Properties

               The following properties specify change management information in
               calendar components.

            4.8.7.1 Date/Time Created

               Property Name: CREATED

               Purpose: This property specifies the date and time that the calendar
               information was created by the calendar user agent in the calendar
               store.

                    Note: This is analogous to the creation date and time for a file
                    in the file system.

               Value Type: DATE-TIME

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: The property can be specified once in "VEVENT", "VTODO"
               or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

               Description: The date and time is a UTC value.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 created    = "CREATED" creaparam ":" date-time CRLF

                 creaparam  = *(";" xparam)

               Example: The following is an example of this property:

                 CREATED:19960329T133000Z             
             */

        {
             /*
            4.8.7.2 Date/Time Stamp

               Property Name: DTSTAMP

               Purpose: The property indicates the date/time that the instance of
               the ICalendar object was created.

               Value Type: DATE-TIME

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property MUST be included in the "VEVENT", "VTODO",
               "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

               Description: The value MUST be specified in the UTC time format.

               This property is also useful to protocols such as [IMIP] that have
               inherent latency issues with the delivery of content. This property
               will assist in the proper sequencing of messages containing ICalendar
               objects.

               This property is different than the "CREATED" and "LAST-MODIFIED"
               properties. These two properties are used to specify when the
               particular calendar data in the calendar store was created and last
               modified. This is different than when the ICalendar object
               representation of the calendar service information was created or
               last modified.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 dtstamp    = "DTSTAMP" stmparam ":" date-time CRLF

                 stmparam   = *(";" xparam)

               Example:

                 DTSTAMP:19971210T080000Z
             
             */

        else if (iCalLine.startsWith("LAST-MODIFIED") )
        {
             /*
            4.8.7.3 Last Modified

               Property Name: LAST-MODIFIED

               Purpose: The property specifies the date and time that the
               information associated with the calendar component was last revised
               in the calendar store.

                    Note: This is analogous to the modification date and time for a
                    file in the file system.

               Value Type: DATE-TIME

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property can be specified in the "EVENT", "VTODO",
               "VJOURNAL" or "VTIMEZONE" calendar components.

               Description: The property value MUST be specified in the UTC time
               format.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 last-mod   = "LAST-MODIFIED" lstparam ":" date-time CRLF

                 lstparam   = *(";" xparam)

               Example: The following is are examples of this property:

                 LAST-MODIFIED:19960817T133000Z
             
             */
        	if (icalEventParser)
        		iCalEvent.setLastModified(convertIcalDate(extractAttribute(iCalLine, "LAST-MODIFIED")));
        }
        else if (iCalLine.startsWith("SEQUENCE") )
        {
             /*
            4.8.7.4 Sequence Number

               Property Name: SEQUENCE

               Purpose: This property defines the revision sequence number of the
               calendar component within a sequence of revisions.

               Value Type: integer

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: The property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO" or
               "VJOURNAL" calendar component.

               Description: When a calendar component is created, its sequence
               number is zero (US-ASCII decimal 48). It is monotonically incremented
               by the "Organizer's" CUA each time the "Organizer" makes a
               significant revision to the calendar component. When the "Organizer"
               makes changes to one of the following properties, the sequence number
               MUST be incremented:

                 .  "DTSTART"

                 .  "DTEND"

                 .  "DUE"

                 .  "RDATE"

                 .  "RRULE"

                 .  "EXDATE"

                 .  "EXRULE"

                 .  "STATUS"

               In addition, changes made by the "Organizer" to other properties can
               also force the sequence number to be incremented. The "Organizer" CUA
               MUST increment the sequence number when ever it makes changes to
               properties in the calendar component that the "Organizer" deems will
               jeopardize the validity of the participation status of the
               "Attendees". For example, changing the location of a meeting from one
               locale to another distant locale could effectively impact the
               participation status of the "Attendees".

               The "Organizer" includes this property in an ICalendar object that it
               sends to an "Attendee" to specify the current version of the calendar
               component.

               The "Attendee" includes this property in an ICalendar object that it
               sends to the "Organizer" to specify the version of the calendar
               component that the "Attendee" is referring to.

               A change to the sequence number is not the mechanism that an
               "Organizer" uses to request a response from the "Attendees". The
               "RSVP" parameter on the "ATTENDEE" property is used by the
               "Organizer" to indicate that a response from the "Attendees" is
               requested.

               Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
               notation:

                 seq = "SEQUENCE" seqparam ":" integer CRLF
                 ; Default is "0"

                 seqparam   = *(";" xparam)

               Example: The following is an example of this property for a calendar
               component that was just created by the "Organizer".

                 SEQUENCE:0

               The following is an example of this property for a calendar component
               that has been revised two different times by the "Organizer".

                 SEQUENCE:2
             
             */

            4.8.8 Miscellaneous Component Properties

               The following properties specify information about a number of
               miscellaneous features of calendar components.

            4.8.8.1 Non-standard Properties

               Property Name: Any property name with a "X-" prefix

               Purpose: This class of property provides a framework for defining
               non-standard properties.

               Value Type: TEXT

               Property Parameters: Non-standard and language property parameters
               can be specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property can be specified in any calendar
               component.

               Description: The MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
               provides a "standard mechanism for doing non-standard things". This
               extension support is provided for implementers to "push the envelope"
               on the existing version of the memo. Extension properties are
               specified by property and/or property parameter names that have the
               prefix text of "X-" (the two character sequence: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
               X character followed by the HYPEN-MINUS character). It is recommended
               that vendors concatenate onto this sentinel another short prefix text
               to identify the vendor. This will facilitate readability of the
               extensions and minimize possible collision of names between different
               vendors. User agents that support this content type are expected to
               be able to parse the extension properties and property parameters but
               can ignore them.

               At present, there is no registration authority for names of extension
               properties and property parameters. The data type for this property
               is TEXT. Optionally, the data type can be any of the other valid data
               types.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

            4.8.8.2 Request Status

               Property Name: REQUEST-STATUS

               Purpose: This property defines the status code returned for a
               scheduling request.

               Value Type: TEXT

               Property Parameters: Non-standard and language property parameters
               can be specified on this property.

               Conformance: The property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO",
               "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar component.

               Description: This property is used to return status code information
               related to the processing of an associated ICalendar object. The data
               type for this property is TEXT.

               The value consists of a short return status component, a longer
               return status description component, and optionally a status-specific
               data component. The components of the value are separated by the
               SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

               The short return status is a PERIOD character (US-ASCII decimal 46)
               separated 3-tuple of integers. For example, "3.1.1". The successive
               levels of integers provide for a successive level of status code
               granularity.

               The following are initial classes for the return status code.
               Individual ICalendar object methods will define specific return
               status codes for these classes. In addition, other classes for the
               return status code may be defined using the registration process
               defined later in this memo.

            Description: This parameter can be specified on properties that are
                           used to reference an object. The parameter specifies the content type
                           of the referenced object. For example, on the "ATTACH" property, a
                           FTP type URI value does not, by itself, necessarily convey the type
                           of content associated with the resource. The parameter value MUST be
                           the TEXT for either an IANA registered content type or a non-standard
                           content type.

                        / iana-token)       
            *
            Description: The parameter specifies the free or busy time type. The
               value FREE indicates that the time interval is free for scheduling.
               The value BUSY indicates that the time interval is busy because one
               or more events have been scheduled for that interval. The value
               BUSY-UNAVAILABLE indicates that the time interval is busy and that
               the interval can not be scheduled. The value BUSY-TENTATIVE indicates
               that the time interval is busy because one or more events have been
               tentatively scheduled for that interval. If not specified on a
               property that allows this parameter, the default is BUSY.    
            Example: The following is an example of this parameter on a FREEBUSY property.
            FREEBUSY;FBTYPE=BUSY:19980415T133000Z/19980415T170000Z

            Description: The parameter can be specified on a property that
            specifies a recurrence identifier. The parameter specifies the
            effective range of recurrence instances that is specified by the
            property. The effective range is from the recurrence identified
            specified by the property. If this parameter is not specified an
            allowed property, then the default range is the single instance
            specified by the recurrence identifier value of the property. The
            parameter value can be "THISANDPRIOR" to indicate a range defined by
            the recurrence identified value of the property and all prior
            instances. The parameter value can also be "THISANDFUTURE" to
            indicate a range defined by the recurrence identifier and all
            subsequent instances.

            Description: The parameter can be specified on properties that
               specify an alarm trigger with a DURATION value type. The parameter
               specifies whether the alarm will trigger relative to the start or end
               of the calendar component. The parameter value START will set the
               alarm to trigger off the start of the calendar component; the
               parameter value END will set the alarm to trigger off the end of the
               calendar component. If the parameter is not specified on an allowable
               property, then the default is START.

            4.7.2 Method

               Property Name: METHOD

               Purpose: This property defines the ICalendar object method associated
               with the calendar object.

               Value Type: TEXT

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: The property can be specified in an ICalendar object.

               Description: When used in a MIME message entity, the value of this
               property MUST be the same as the Content-Type "method" parameter
               value. This property can only appear once within the ICalendar
               object. If either the "METHOD" property or the Content-Type "method"
               parameter is specified, then the other MUST also be specified.

               No methods are defined by this specification. This is the subject of
               other specifications, such as the ICalendar Transport-independent

               Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) defined by [ITIP].

               If this property is not present in the ICalendar object, then a
               scheduling transaction MUST NOT be assumed. In such cases, the
               ICalendar object is merely being used to transport a snapshot of some
               calendar information; without the intention of conveying a scheduling
               semantic.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 method     = "METHOD" metparam ":" metvalue CRLF

                 metparam   = *(";" xparam)

                 metvalue   = iana-token

               Example: The following is a hypothetical example of this property to
               convey that the ICalendar object is a request for a meeting:

                 METHOD:REQUEST             
            
        }

             4.8.2.6 Free/Busy Time

               Property Name: FREEBUSY

               Purpose: The property defines one or more free or busy time
               intervals.

               Value Type: PERIOD. The date and time values MUST be in an UTC time
               format.

               Property Parameters: Non-standard or free/busy time type property
               parameters can be specified on this property.

               Conformance: The property can be specified in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar
               component.

               Property Parameter: "FBTYPE" and non-standard parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Description: These time periods can be specified as either a start
               and end date-time or a start date-time and duration. The date and
               time MUST be a UTC time format.

               "FREEBUSY" properties within the "VFREEBUSY" calendar component
               SHOULD be sorted in ascending order, based on start time and then end
               time, with the earliest periods first.

               The "FREEBUSY" property can specify more than one value, separated by
               the COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44). In such cases, the
               "FREEBUSY" property values SHOULD all be of the same "FBTYPE"
               property parameter type (e.g., all values of a particular "FBTYPE"
               listed together in a single property).

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 freebusy   = "FREEBUSY" fbparam ":" fbvalue
                              CRLF

                 fbparam    = *(
                            ; the following is optional,
                            ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                            (";" fbtypeparam) /

                            ; the following is optional,
                            ; and MAY occur more than once

                            (";" xparam)

                            )

                 fbvalue    = period *["," period]
                 ;Time value MUST be in the UTC time format.

               Example: The following are some examples of this property:

                 FREEBUSY;FBTYPE=BUSY-UNAVAILABLE:19970308T160000Z/PT8H30M

                 FREEBUSY;FBTYPE=FREE:19970308T160000Z/PT3H,19970308T200000Z/PT1H

        }                                                                          
                                                                                                                            
        else if (iCalLine.startsWith("EXRULE") )
        {
            
            4.8.5.2 Exception Rule

               Property Name: EXRULE

               Purpose: This property defines a rule or repeating pattern for an
               exception to a recurrence set.

               Value Type: RECUR

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO" or
               "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

               Description: The exception rule, if specified, is used in computing
               the recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of
               recurrence instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is
               generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with
               the "RRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained
               within the ICalendar object. The "DTSTART" defines the first instance
               in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and "EXRULE"
               properties can also be specified to define more sophisticated
               recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated by gathering
               all of the start date-times generated by any of the specified "RRULE"
               and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start date and times which
               fall within the union of start date and times generated by any
               specified "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that start
               date and times within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE"
               and "EXRULE") take precedence over those specified by inclusion
               properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are
               generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence
               is considered. Duplicate instances are ignored.

               The "EXRULE" property can be used to exclude the value specified in
               "DTSTART". However, in such cases the original "DTSTART" date MUST
               still be maintained by the calendaring and scheduling system because
               the original "DTSTART" value has inherent usage dependencies by other
               properties such as the "RECURRENCE-ID".

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 exrule     = "EXRULE" exrparam ":" recur CRLF

                 exrparam   = *(";" xparam)

               Example: The following are examples of this property. Except every
               other week, on Tuesday and Thursday for 4 occurrences:

                 EXRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=4;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=TU,TH

               Except daily for 10 occurrences:

                 EXRULE:FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10

               Except yearly in June and July for 8 occurrences:

                 EXRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;COUNT=8;BYMONTH=6,7

            4.8.5.3 Recurrence Date/Times

               Property Name: RDATE

               Purpose: This property defines the list of date/times for a
               recurrence set.

               Value Type: The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
               The value type can be set to DATE or PERIOD.

               Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type and time zone
               identifier property parameters can be specified on this property.

               Conformance: The property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO",
               "VJOURNAL" or "VTIMEZONE" calendar components.

               Description: This property can appear along with the "RRULE" property
               to define an aggregate set of repeating occurrences. When they both
               appear in an ICalendar object, the recurring events are defined by
               the union of occurrences defined by both the "RDATE" and "RRULE".

               The recurrence dates, if specified, are used in computing the
               recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of recurrence
               instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is generated
               by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with the "RRULE",
               "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained within the
               ICalendar object. The "DTSTART" property defines the first instance
               in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and "EXRULE"
               properties can also be specified to define more sophisticated
               recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated by gathering
               all of the start date/times generated by any of the specified "RRULE"
               and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start date/times which fall
               within the union of start date/times generated by any specified
               "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that start date/times
               within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE" and "EXRULE")
               take precedence over those specified by inclusion properties (i.e.,
               "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are generated by the
               "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence is considered.
               Duplicate instances are ignored.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 rdate      = "RDATE" rdtparam ":" rdtval *("," rdtval) CRLF

                 rdtparam   = *(

                            ; the following are optional,
                            ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                            (";" "VALUE" "=" ("DATE-TIME" / "DATE" / "PERIOD")) /
                            (";" tzidparam) /

                            ; the following is optional,
                            ; and MAY occur more than once

                            (";" xparam)

                            )

                 rdtval     = date-time / date / period
                 ;Value MUST match value type

               Example: The following are examples of this property:

                 RDATE:19970714T123000Z

                 RDATE;TZID=US-EASTERN:19970714T083000

                 RDATE;VALUE=PERIOD:19960403T020000Z/19960403T040000Z,
                  19960404T010000Z/PT3H

                 RDATE;VALUE=DATE:19970101,19970120,19970217,19970421

            4.8.6 Alarm Component Properties

               The following properties specify alarm information in calendar
               components.

            4.8.6.1 Action

               Property Name: ACTION

               Purpose: This property defines the action to be invoked when an alarm
               is triggered.

               Value Type: TEXT

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property MUST be specified once in a "VALARM"
               calendar component.

               Description: Each "VALARM" calendar component has a particular type
               of action associated with it. This property specifies the type of
               action

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 action     = "ACTION" actionparam ":" actionvalue CRLF

                 actionparam        = *(";" xparam)

                 actionvalue        = "AUDIO" / "DISPLAY" / "EMAIL" / "PROCEDURE"
                                    / iana-token / x-name

               Example: The following are examples of this property in a "VALARM"
               calendar component:

                 ACTION:AUDIO

                 ACTION:DISPLAY

                 ACTION:PROCEDURE             
             
        }        
        
                else if (iCalLine.startsWith("REPEAT") )
        {
             
            4.8.6.2 Repeat Count

               Property Name: REPEAT

               Purpose: This property defines the number of time the alarm should be
               repeated, after the initial trigger.

               Value Type: INTEGER

               Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
               specified on this property.

               Conformance: This property can be specified in a "VALARM" calendar
               component.

               Description: If the alarm triggers more than once, then this property
               MUST be specified along with the "DURATION" property.

               Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                 repeatcnt  = "REPEAT" repparam ":" integer CRLF
                 ;Default is "0", zero.

                 repparam   = *(";" xparam)

               Example: The following is an example of this property for an alarm
               that repeats 4 additional times with a 5 minute delay after the
               initial triggering of the alarm:

                 REPEAT:4
                 DURATION:PT5M

             
        }
        else if (iCalLine.startsWith("TRIGGER") )
        {
             
                4.8.6.3 Trigger

                   Property Name: TRIGGER

                   Purpose: This property specifies when an alarm will trigger.

                   Value Type: The default value type is DURATION. The value type can be
                   set to a DATE-TIME value type, in which case the value MUST specify a
                   UTC formatted DATE-TIME value.

                   Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type, time zone
                   identifier or trigger relationship property parameters can be
                   specified on this property. The trigger relationship property
                   parameter MUST only be specified when the value type is DURATION.

                   Conformance: This property MUST be specified in the "VALARM" calendar
                   component.

                   Description: Within the "VALARM" calendar component, this property
                   defines when the alarm will trigger. The default value type is
                   DURATION, specifying a relative time for the trigger of the alarm.
                   The default duration is relative to the start of an event or to-do
                   that the alarm is associated with. The duration can be explicitly set
                   to trigger from either the end or the start of the associated event
                   or to-do with the "RELATED" parameter. A value of START will set the
                   alarm to trigger off the start of the associated event or to-do. A
                   value of END will set the alarm to trigger off the end of the
                   associated event or to-do.

                   Either a positive or negative duration may be specified for the
                   "TRIGGER" property. An alarm with a positive duration is triggered
                   after the associated start or end of the event or to-do. An alarm
                   with a negative duration is triggered before the associated start or
                   end of the event or to-do.

                   The "RELATED" property parameter is not valid if the value type of
                   the property is set to DATE-TIME (i.e., for an absolute date and time
                   alarm trigger). If a value type of DATE-TIME is specified, then the
                   property value MUST be specified in the UTC time format. If an
                   absolute trigger is specified on an alarm for a recurring event or
                   to-do, then the alarm will only trigger for the specified absolute
                   date/time, along with any specified repeating instances.

                   If the trigger is set relative to START, then the "DTSTART" property
                   MUST be present in the associated "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar
                   component. If an alarm is specified for an event with the trigger set
                   relative to the END, then the "DTEND" property or the "DSTART" and
                   "DURATION' properties MUST be present in the associated "VEVENT"
                   calendar component. If the alarm is specified for a to-do with a
                   trigger set relative to the END, then either the "DUE" property or
                   the "DSTART" and "DURATION' properties MUST be present in the
                   associated "VTODO" calendar component.

                   Alarms specified in an event or to-do which is defined in terms of a
                   DATE value type will be triggered relative to 00:00:00 UTC on the
                   specified date. For example, if "DTSTART:19980205, then the duration
                   trigger will be relative to19980205T000000Z.

                   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                     trigger    = "TRIGGER" (trigrel / trigabs)

                     trigrel    = *(

                                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                                  (";" "VALUE" "=" "DURATION") /
                                  (";" trigrelparam) /

                                ; the following is optional,
                                ; and MAY occur more than once

                                  (";" xparam)
                                  ) ":"  dur-value

                     trigabs    = 1*(

                                ; the following is REQUIRED,
                                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                                  (";" "VALUE" "=" "DATE-TIME") /

                                ; the following is optional,
                                ; and MAY occur more than once

                                  (";" xparam)

                                  ) ":" date-time

                   Example: A trigger set 15 minutes prior to the start of the event or
                   to-do.

                     TRIGGER:-P15M

                   A trigger set 5 minutes after the end of the event or to-do.

                     TRIGGER;RELATED=END:P5M

                   A trigger set to an absolute date/time.

                     TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME:19980101T050000Z             
            
        }
